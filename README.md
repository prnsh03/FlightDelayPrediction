# Flight Delay Prediction

Welcome to the Flight Delay Prediction Model project! This repository contains a data science project focused on predicting flight delays using machine learning techniques.

Project Overview:

The goal of this project is to develop a machine learning model that can predict flight delays accurately. Flight delays can have a significant impact on travel plans, and by predicting delays in advance, we can provide valuable information to airlines, passengers, and other stakeholders.

This repository contains a data science project that focuses on predicting flight delays using machine learning techniques. The dataset consists of historical flight data, and the project includes Jupyter notebooks for data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, model development, and evaluation. The trained machine learning model and associated files are stored in the 'models' directory.
