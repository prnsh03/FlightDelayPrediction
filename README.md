## Flight Delay Prediction

### Overview

This project aims to predict flight delays using machine learning algorithms. It utilizes a dataset containing flight details from January 2019 and explores various features to build models that can classify flights as delayed or not delayed. The primary goal is to provide insights into factors affecting flight delays and develop accurate predictive models for future delay occurrences.

### Data Preparation

The project starts with data preparation, including:

- Reading the dataset containing flight details for January 2019.
- Creating a binary classification label for delays based on departure and arrival delay information.
- Removing canceled and diverted flights from the dataset.
- Dropping irrelevant columns and handling missing values.
- Encoding categorical variables for modeling.

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

EDA is performed to gain insights into the dataset and understand the relationships between features and flight delays. Key visualizations include histograms, correlation heatmaps, and analysis of delay patterns by factors such as airline, distance, day of the week, and time of day.

### Modeling

Several machine learning models are trained and evaluated for their ability to predict flight delays. Models include:

- Random Forest
- Gradient Boosting
- Decision Tree
- AdaBoost

Model evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrices are used to assess the performance of each model.

### Results

- Random Forest emerges as the best-performing model, providing the highest accuracy among the models tested.
- Feature importance analysis reveals that factors such as day of the month, day of the week, airline code, departure time, and distance play significant roles in predicting flight delays.

### Hyperparameter Tuning

Hyperparameter tuning is performed for the Random Forest model to optimize its performance further. After tuning, the model's accuracy is re-evaluated to assess improvement.

### Conclusion

The project demonstrates the feasibility of using machine learning techniques to predict flight delays based on historical flight data. By leveraging various features, including temporal, spatial, and categorical information, accurate models can be developed to assist airlines and passengers in anticipating and mitigating potential delays. Further optimization and fine-tuning of models can potentially enhance predictive capabilities, leading to more efficient air travel operations and better customer experiences.
